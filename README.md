# NotARobot
One of the first ever production Natural Language Processing Discord bots! Features include
- human-like interaction with server members in DMs
- forwarding DMs to server admins (this is its main function)
- generating random John Mulaney quotes
- logging of unknown phrases and their frequency for situation-specific additions to intents.json
- and more!

If you do decide to use this bot by cloning from this repo (which is not recommended), please note that you will have to create an unknown.json file and an empty synapses.json file, as well as install several dependencies.
